		<h2>A privacy-first period tracking app.</h2>

		<p>
			We could almost all agree that it's never been more important for us
			to OWN OUR INFORMATION, not governments or "big tech" companies, so
			that we decide what is done with that information.
		</p>

		<p>
			We believe that especially goes for private medical/health data, of
			which menstrual tracking (for women / people with uteruses) might
			just be some of the most sensitive and important to protect.
		</p>

		<p>
			Companies and apps can promise all they want that they're being safe
			and private with our information. But if they have our information,
			and they're a company, they're going to have to make money somehow,
			either by charging us for it, or worse, charging someone else to use
			it in some way.
		</p>

		<p>
			We believe this kind of private and sensitive medical information
			belongs to you, and you alone. As such, YOU. (the app) puts you in
			control of all your information, and never collects or tracks
			anything about you, not even your name or email address. Since we
			don't have any of your data, we obviously CANNOT sell it or hand it
			over to any governmental authority.
		</p>

		<p>
			Everything you enter into YOU. (the app) is yours, always and only
			yours. It stays on your device, protected and secure, and you decide
			what to do with that information.
		</p>

		<p>This app is free to use, and will remain so forever.</p>

		<p>
			Once installed, this web-app (PWA) runs entirely offline -- only
			locally on your device, with no need for any internet or to connect
			to any remote service -- and uses strong cryptography practices to
			keep your data secure and private on your device, ONLY.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's built with love and respect, for you, and only about you, and
			only to help you keep and track your own private health information.
			That's it. Period.
